Many different management and development tools were used during the project. Management tools were used to ensure the project continued according to plan, and that if changes in direction needed to be made, they were documented and made in the most appropriate way. Developemt tools were used to ensure that the design, research, and implementation stages progressed as efficiently as possible, and that the quality of the produced system was as high as possible.

\subsection{Management Tools}
The management tools used in the project are shown in figure \ref{management_tools_logos}, and are discussed below.

\subsubsection{Atom \cite{atom}}
\textit{Atom} was used as a text editor for writing the specification, progress report, and final report of the project. These are all key components of the project, and \textit{Atom} eased the editing process.

\subsubsection{git \cite{git}}
\textit{git} was used for version control for all the the source code and document code of the project. This allowed changes made throughout the development of the system to be tracked and recorded, and makes the code's full history available to be viewed.

\subsubsection{GitHub \cite{github}}

\subsubsection{LaTeX \cite{latex}}
\subsubsection{Resilio Sync \cite{resilio_sync}}
\subsubsection{Trello \cite{trello}}
