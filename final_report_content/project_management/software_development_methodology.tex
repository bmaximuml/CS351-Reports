% very very agile
% due to flexible objectives
% Regular meetings with supervisor (like scrums)
  % helped with direction of project

% why not waterfall?
% changing requirements, changing title, tools not available

% From spec
This project will use an Agile methodology so that it can adapt to changes which arise during the project. Since the research and implementation stages of the project will contribute to confirming its direction, this flexibilty is important. In addition, git \cite{git} will be used to track changes in both written documents and code developed, such as P4 or Verilog code. Repositories will be set up using git for the different areas of the project, and these repositories will be stored primarily on an online GitHub \cite{github} server that will be backed up regularly.
% The Gantt chart in Figure \ref{gantt_chart} has been constructed to show an outline of the project timetable, and is intentionally flexible for the changes that will take place.
