% Those guys who we wanted to get the P4 resources never delivered

% Can you make a risk thing from project management module?
  % With severity and probability

% Maybe a table?

% Complete failure of main device (i.e. Iroh) :  Backups were taken regularly, and alternative devices were available
% github dies : local copy availble, resilio sync backups avilable, will switch to gitlab.com
% mininet stops being supported : existing version of mininet still available, development limited to Ubuntu 16.04 (are there alternatives?)
% Changes to any third party libraries? : find alternatives or stick with most recent versions
% Single developer : agile, and regular supervisor meetings. constantly ensuring goals were feasible in case developer got ill or somethign
% ESLP issues : BCS guidelines, and anonymity
