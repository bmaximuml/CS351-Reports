This project investigated FPGA-based smart network switches, and implemented a system to model these in a network.
The project conducted research into how these devices could be designed and constructed, and what sort of challenges may be encountered.
The implemented system was developed with a strong focus on good development practice, and as a result is efficient, easy to read, and follows the stylistic guide for the language in which it is written.
It has been made open-source, which encourages future work and follows the BCS Code of Conduct principle of ``You make IT for everyone'' \cite{bcs_code_of_conduct}.
While the project does not meet the original objectives or requirements of the specification, the new aims and requirements created as the project developed are sufficiently substantial to declare the project a success.
