Prior to the start of this project, some existing knowledge was used to assist in choosing the direction for the project, and finding different research areas. These are detailed below.

\subsection{Networking Concepts}
\label{networking_concepts_introduction}
The Warwick Computer Science module \textit{Operating Systems and Computer Networks} \cite{cs241} provided a background for many basic networking concepts, including the \textit{OSI network model} and the \textit{TCP/IP network model}, both of which are further discussed in section \ref{network_models}. This module aimed to understand the purpose of each layer of the \textit{OSI network model} (shown in table \ref{osi_model}), and where this information has been of relevance to this project, it has been used a basis for the research shown in section \ref{research}.

Working with networking hardware including network switches as part of the \textit{Warwick Student Cinema} \cite{wsc} provided practical experience with this equipment. This proved useful throughout the project, as is allowed for an additional viewpoint to be taken towards the project, i.e. that of someone who manages network infrastructure. Thinking about how the hardware side of the project would integrate with existing hardware is an important consideration, as it will limit the marketability of the project.

This experience, improved by a recent visit to a datacentre, provided a basic understanding of the different physical media used in network cables. The primary two mediums are UTP made of copper, or fibre optics, often referred to simply as ``fibre''. This has been researched further and discussed in more detail in section \ref{physical_media_research}

\subsection{FPGAs}
\label{fpgas}

The Warwick Engineering modules \textit{Digital Systems Design} \cite{es3b2} and \textit{High Performance Embedded Systems Design} \cite{es3f1} provided the core concepts of FPGAs. This included the FPGA's basic structure of LUTs, block memories, DSP blocks, and IO, how FPGAs compared to ASICs and CPUs in terms of speed, flexibility, and price, different ways applications of FPGAs, and more. This background was crucial to the project, and motivated many of the initial targets and aims for the project.
