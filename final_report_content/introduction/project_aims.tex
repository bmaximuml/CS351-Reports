% This is what we're aiming to do with the project.
% In our case, it's create this python script.
% It's not, it's the FPGA-based smart switches. The python script is simply the implemented aspect.

% So what we want to be doing is talking about the research.
%   Use words like investigate a lot.
%   Look at the aims of the other projects.

% It's also very important to talk about the reasoning behind all of the aims

% Create an application to model networks containing FPGA-based smart switches
% Allow users to test whether FPGA smart switches would be suitable in their network

% Something to do with implementing on NetFPGA?
% Something to do with SDN, control plane


% Coles: 
%   Connect platforms
%   Connect people
%   use simple techniques
%   provide recommendations

%%% STRUCTURE %%%%

% Coles
  % Different subsections for each aim
  % 3 - 6 aims

% Dutton
  % no subsections
  % 1 overarching aim, 1-2 sub aims

% Thompson
  % Talk about how the aims changed after the project started
  % i.e. initially the aims were to build the hardware, but that changed to be more research focus
