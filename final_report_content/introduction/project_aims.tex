% This is what we're aiming to do with the project.
% In our case, it's create this python script.
% It's also very important to talk about the reasoning behind all of the aims

% Create an application to model networks containing FPGA-based smart switches
% Allow users to test whether FPGA smart switches would be suitable in their network

% Something to do with implementing on NetFPGA?
% Something to do with SDN, control plane
