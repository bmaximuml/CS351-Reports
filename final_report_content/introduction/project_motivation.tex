% Current state:
  % Cloud computing
    % High latencies
    % large datacentres
    % AWS/Azure/hadoop
% Existing solutions and issues
  % Mainframes
    % inflexible
    % high maintenance
    % single point of failure
    % very expensive
    % more
  % "edge" / "gateway" nodes
    % essentially just small datacentres
    % similar downsides
  % NetFPGA
    % doesn't solve problem
  % SDN
    % doesn't solve problem

  % Other drawbacks
    % security
    % scalability
    % Flexibility
    % performance

% Why this, and why this is different?
  % Don't divert data from current path.
    % It's heading to datacentre, so use that path.
  % choose appropriate device
    % ASIC vs FPGA vs CPU

% Why FPGAs?
  % Custom compute architectures - very low latency
  % why not CPU? (bring data in through NIC -> mobo -> mem -> cache -> reg -> CPU -> back out)
    % FPGA just in and out
  % Partial reconfiguration
