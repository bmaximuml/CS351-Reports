The primary ethical for this project was privacy. While no user data is directly required for this project, a wide variety of data would naturall pass through a complete FPGA-based smart network switch.
As a result, when designing these devices, or even just considering the foundation for them, it is important to ensure that they are secure, and would be resistant to malicious attempts to read data passing through the switches.

This can link to the physical media discussed in section \ref{physical_media_research}. Fibre optic cable is significantly more secure than UTP copper cable, which is susceptible to `tapping', where an additional cable can be attached to the original copper cable, and this can be used to read the data flowing through it. This technique is extremely difficult with fibre optic cable, since attempts to do so will almost always break the cable.
This ethical issue should influence the design of the FPGA-based smart network switches, and the types of physical media they are compatible with.
