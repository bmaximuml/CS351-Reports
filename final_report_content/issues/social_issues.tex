Wherever users are involved with this project, for example user testing, all user data will be entirely anonymised to prevent the possibility of discrimination or bias.
Where user data is required, all effort will be made to avoid collecting data that could identify an individual, as well as data that could be used in an inappropriate way, such as gender, sexual orientation, religion, or political status.
As stated above, the BCS Code of Conduct will be used wherever appropriate throughout the project.
