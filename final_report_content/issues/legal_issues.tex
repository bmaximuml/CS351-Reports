When using third-party tools, it is important to ensure that they are being used in accordance with the licence with which they are provided.
Much open-source software is provided with either the \textit{Apache License 2.0} \cite{apache_2_0}, the \textit{GNU General Public License v3.0} \cite{gnu_gpl_3}, or other similar licences allowing conditional free use of the software.
As a result, this project will aim to use open-source tools where they are available to avoid issues with copyright.

Two Regulations this project will additionally be careful not to contravene are the \textit{General Data Protection Regulation 2016} \cite{eu_2016_679} and the \textit{Data Protection Act 2018} \cite{uk_dpa_2018}. This legislation involves the storage, collection, and processing of data, and relates to the issues descibed in sections \ref{ethical_issues} and \ref{social_issues}.

Wherever secondary data (i.e. data not directly collected by the developer) has been used, any conditions to the use of this data must be considered. Should any terms of use relating to the data be accepted, these must be adhered to, and the primary stakeholders outlined in section \ref{primary_stakeholders} should be aware of any consequences that could occur from breaching these terms of use.
