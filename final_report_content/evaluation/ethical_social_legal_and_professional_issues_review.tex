\subsection{Ethical Issues}
 % open source
The issue of privacy was successfully addressed in this project by not incorporating any user data. While the implemented system allows for options to be specified at the command line, none of these options could be used to identify an individual.

Should FPGA-based smart network switches become commercially manufactured, this project would recommend the exclusive use of fibre optics in order to increase the security of the data passing through the systems.

\subsection{Social Issues}


\subsection{Legal Issues}
The project achieved its goal of using exclusively open-source libraries in the system, and the source code for all of these libraries can be found on \textit{GitHub}.
This ensured that there would be no copyright issues arising from the project.

In addition, since no user data was required during the project, the risk of any breach of the \textit{General Data Protection Regulation 2016} \cite{eu_2016_679} or the \textit{Data Protection Act 2018} \cite{uk_dpa_2018} was significantly reduced, as there was no user data to misuse.

\subsection{Professional Issues}

By following the BCS Code of Conduct \cite{bcs_code_of_conduct} throughout the project and engaging with the ideas and suggestions of the project supervisor, Dr Suhaib Fahmy, the project managed to avoid any notable professional issues. All research conducted throughout the project has been credited to its original founders, and the system developed by the project has been made open-source in order to share the knowledge gained from this project.
