\subsection{Ethical Issues}
 % open source
The issue of privacy was successfully eliminated in this project by not requiring any user data. While the allows for options to be specified at the command line, no data can be provided which would identify an individual.

Should FPGA-based smart network switches become commercially manufactured, this project would reccomend the exclusive use of fibre optics in order to increase the security of the data passing through the systems.

\subsection{Social Issues}


\subsection{Legal Issues}
The project achieved its goal of using exclusively open-source libraries in the system, and the source code for all of these libraries can be found on \textit{GitHub}.
This prevented potential copyright issues from occuring during the project.

In additon, since no user data was required during the project, the risk of the \textit{General Data Protection Regulation 2016} \cite{eu_2016_679} or the \textit{Data Protection Act 2018} \cite{uk_dpa_2018} was significantly reduced, as there was naturally no user data to misuse.

\subsection{Professional Issues}
