The success of this project would not have been possible without the contributions of a number of individuals.
Firstly, I would like to thank my project supervisor and personal tutor, Dr Suhaib Fahmy, who has not only helped to conceive this project and to guide it through all stages of its development, but has also provided an enormous amount of time and guidance over the past three years while I have been at university.
Both with respect to this project and my time at university in general, I have been exceptionally fortunate to receive the level of support I have from him, and it is greatly appreciated.
I would also like to thank my personal tutor in the Department of Computer Science, Dr Matthew Leeke, for his support and constant open door policy, as well as for the time he has taken to review this report and offer advice.
Finally, I would like to thank Dr Sascha Ott for taking the time to view my presentation and provide productive feedback on it.
