This project investigates the design of network switches based on FPGAs.
The FPGAs will perform computation on the data passing through the switches, either processing the data completely and returning it, or processing the data partially and sending it further along its original path.
% These FPGA-based smart network switches which will perform computation on the data passing through the switches.
A system of this nature would reduce the latency of any packets which are processed to completion and returned, since the distance they will have travelled will be significantly reduced compared to having to be sent all the way to a cloud data centre.

To aid with this investigation, this project implements a system to model these switches in a virtual network.
Among other customisation options, this system allows users to customise the topology used by the model, which aims to help users determine whether FPGA-based smart network switches would be suitable for their specific network.
