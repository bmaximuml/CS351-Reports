\textit{P4} is a language used in SDN for programming the data plane of network devices \cite{P4}. The specification for $P\mathit{4_{14}}$ (the first version of \textit{P4}) was released in September 2014. This went through a few minor revisions before the specification for $P\mathit{4_{16}}$ (the current version) was released. \textit{P4} is a language which could be used on an FPGA-based smart network switch in order to control how packets are processed through the switch, but is not used in the implementation aspect of this project.

% P4 is a language for programming the data plane of network devices \cite{P4}. The specification for $P4_{14}$ (the first version of P4) was released in September 2014. This went through a few minor revisions before the specification for $P4_{16}$ (the current version) was released. This project will use $P4_{16}$.
