The primary benefit of SDN is that it gives the programmer more direct and clear control over how routing decisions are made. SDN aims to separate the network control, known as the control plane, from the forwarding proces, known as the data plane \cite{software_defined_networking_survey}. The control plane makes decisions about packets which are either destined to or originally from the current host, while the data plane makes decisions about packets which are going through the host. The control plane also maintains the routing table, which is used by both planes to make routing decisions.
