% From spec
The NetFPGA \cite{NetFPGA} platform is intended to be used for this project. It is an ``open source hardware and software platform designed for research and teaching'' \cite{NetFPGA_about}. Of the four hardware plaforms available, the NetFPGA 1G \cite{NetFPGA_1G} is the most suitable for this project, since its hardware is most compatible with general purpose consumer hardware. The other three platforms could be used to create faster circuits than the NetFPGA 1G, but these may require additional hardware, which is not currently available for this project. This platform is based around a \textit{Xilinx Virtex-II Pro 50} \cite{virtex2-pro} which contains 53,136 logic cells and 4kb block RAM. In addition, the NetFPGA 1G contains four Gigabit Ethernet networking ports, 4.5MB of SRAM, and 64MB of DDR2 DRAM. It has a standard PCI form factor, and so is compatible with most consumer motherboards.
