% base off spec, but adapt to new system
% have a brief description of non func reqs (what they are)

These requirements describe the general operation of the system produced, as well as how the project should be developed. They often apply to the system as a whole rather than targeting individual components, and they can include any legislative constraints on the system \cite{software_engineering_req_analysis}.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{NF\arabic*:}]
    \item The system \textbf{must} be modular, to allow extensibility.
    \item The system \textbf{should} be scalable.
    \item All third-party libraries used by the system \textbf{should} be open-source.
    \item The system \textbf{should} be efficient, able to run all tests on relatively large virtual networks in small amounts of time.
    \item All code for the system \textbf{should} be well-documented and maintainable.
\end{enumerate}
