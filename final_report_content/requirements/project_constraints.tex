This project is subject to a number of constraints which limit the capabilities or scope of the project.
These have been separated into the constraints affected the implemented aspect of the project, the constraints which would apply to an FPGA-based smart network switch, and the constraints on the management aspect of the project.

\subsection{System Constraints}
The constraints described in this section affected the implemented aspect of the system. As a dependency of the system, \textit{Mininet} \cite{mininet} imposed a number of constraints, largely relating to the software of the system. \textit{Mininet}'s API is written in \textit{Python}, which restricts the system to using \textit{Python} as well. Naturally it would be possible to combine an alternative language with Python, and simply use \textit{Python} to interact with the API, however this would introduce an additional level of complexity to the project with little potential benefit, since any improvements in speed offered by a different language would be bottlenecked by the \textit{Python} API.

The most recent stable version of \textit{Mininet}, 2.2.2, uses \textit{Python} 2.7, an older version of Python due to be deprecated on 1 January 2020. While the next stable release of \textit{Mininet} is expected to be updated to use \textit{Python} 3, this has required the project to also use \textit{Python} 2.7.

\textit{Mininet} 2.2.2 contains a known issue with Ubuntu 16.04 or newer due to an incompatibility with the Linux kernel versions 3.16 and higher. As a result, \textit{Mininet} recommends using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, which was released in April 2014. Normal LTS support for Ubuntu 14.04 ended on 25 April 2019, at which point futher security updates for the OS are only available to those who have purchased ``Extended Security Maintenance'' for it \cite{ubuntu_14_04_release}. As mentioned in section \ref{mininet}, the next stable release of \textit{Mininet} is expected to be supported on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
