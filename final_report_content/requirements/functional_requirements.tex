% base off spec, but adapt to new system
% have a brief description of func reqs (what they are)

The functional requirements describe the technical capabilities of the implemented aspect of the project.
They detail how the system should react in certain scenarios, and state what services the system should be able to provide.
The can also state limitations in the scope of the system, i.e. routes of development that are not intended to be implemented \cite{software_engineering_req_analysis}.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{F\arabic*:}]
  \item The system must \textbf{must} provide customisable 
\end{enumerate}

% \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{F\arabic*:}]
%   \item The system \textbf{must} be able to analyse packets at layer 2 of the OSI network model
%   \item The system \textbf{must} be able to send packets to the correct port based on MAC addresses
%   \item The system \textbf{must} be able to store MAC address tables
%   \item The system \textbf{must} be able to dynamically update MAC address tables
%   \item The average latency of the system \textbf{must} be measured
%   \item The throughput of the system \textbf{must} be measured
%   \item The system \textbf{should} be able to analyse packets at layer 3 of the OSI network model
%   \item The system \textbf{could} be able to analyse packets at layer 7 of the OSI network model
%   \item The system \textbf{could} be able to detect basic network attacks (such as TCP SYN Flooding \cite{rfc4987})
%   \item The system \textbf{could} implement features of a basic firewall (such as packet filtering \cite{rfc2979})
% \end{enumerate}
