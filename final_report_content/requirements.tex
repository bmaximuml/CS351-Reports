In order to achieve the aims of the project discussed in section \ref{project_aims}, a set of requirements have been constructed.
These requirements will assist in defining the scope of the project, as well as defining the aims in a more practical manner.
The requirements have been written using the \textit{MoSCoW} method \cite{moscow}, and have been separated into functional and non-functional requirements.
