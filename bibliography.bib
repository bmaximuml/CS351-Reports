    abstract = {Abstract With the advent of cloud computing, many new networking concepts have been introduced to simplify network management and bring innovation through network programmability. The emergence of the software-defined networking (SDN) paradigm is one of these adopted concepts in the cloud model so as to eliminate the network infrastructure maintenance processes and guarantee easy management. In this fashion, SDN offers real-time performance and responds to high availability requirements. However, this new emerging paradigm has been facing many technological hurdles; some of them are inherent, while others are inherited from existing adopted technologies. In this paper, our purpose is to shed light on SDN related issues and give insight into the challenges facing the future of this revolutionary network model, from both protocol and architecture perspectives. Additionally, we aim to present different existing solutions and mitigation techniques that address SDN scalability, elasticity, dependability, reliability, high availability, resiliency, security, and performance concerns.

abstract={We recently published our proposal for Ethane: A clean- slate approach to managing and securing enterprise networks. The goal of Ethane is to make enterprise networks (e.g. networks in companies, universities, and home offices) much easier to manage. Ethane is built on the premise that the only way to manage and secure networks is to make sure we can identify the origin of all traffic, and hold someone (or some machine) accountable for it. So first, Ethane authenticates every human, computer and switch in the network, and tracks them at all times. Every packet can be immediately identified with its sender. Second, Ethane implements a network-wide policy language in terms of users, machines and services. Before a flow is allowed into the network, it is checked against the policy. Ethane requires two substantial changes to the network: Network switches and routers are replaced with much simpler switches, which are based on flow tables. The switch doesn't learn addresses, doesn't run spanning tree, routing protocols or any access control lists. All it does is permit or deny flows under the control of a central controller. The controller is the second big change. Each network contains a central controller that decides if a flow is to be allowed into the network. It makes its decisions based on a set of rules that make up a policy. One premise of Ethane is that although the network is much more powerful as a whole, the switches are much simpler than conventional switches and routers. To explore whether this is true, we built 4-port Ethane switches in dedicated hardware (on the NetFPGA platform), running at 1Gb/s per port. We have deployed the switches in our network at Stanford University, and demonstrated that despite the simplicity of the switches, Ethane can support a very feature-rich and easy-to-manage network.},

abstract={The growing interest in the Internet of Things (IoT) has resulted in a number of wide-area deployments of IoT subnetworks, where multiple heterogeneous wireless communication solutions coexist: from multiple access technologies such as cellular, WiFi, ZigBee, and Bluetooth, to multi-hop ad-hoc and MANET routing protocols, they all must be effectively integrated to create a seamless communication platform. Managing these open, geographically distributed, and heterogeneous networking infrastructures, especially in dynamic environments, is a key technical challenge. In order to take full advantage of the many opportunities they provide, techniques to concurrently provision the different classes of IoT traffic across a common set of sensors and networking resources must be designed. In this paper, we will design a software-defined approach for the IoT environment to dynamically achieve differentiated quality levels to different IoT tasks in very heterogeneous wireless networking scenarios. For this, we extend the Multinetwork INformation Architecture (MINA), a reflective (self-observing and adapting via an embodied Observe-Analyze-Adapt loop) middleware with a layered IoT SDN controller. The developed IoT SDN controller originally i) incorporates and supports commands to differentiate flow scheduling over task-level, multi-hop, and heterogeneous ad-hoc paths and ii) exploits Network Calculus and Genetic Algorithms to optimize the usage of currently available IoT network opportunities. We have applied the extended MINA SDN prototype in the challenging IoT scenario of wide-scale integration of electric vehicles, electric charging sites, smart grid infrastructures, and a wide set of pilot users, as targeted by the Artemis Internet of Energy and Arrowhead projects. Preliminary simulation performance results indicate that our approach and the extended MINA system can support efficient exploitation of the IoT multinetwork capabilities.},
